The document is overcrowded with text and formatting that isn‚Äôt ATS-friendly, the summary is too role-specific, hackathon experiences are placed under work experience instead of projects, the skills section is too broad and looks like a keyword dump, project descriptions are overly detailed without clear business impact, and the education is positioned too low for a student profile.
